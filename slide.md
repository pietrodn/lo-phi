# Open challenges in Dynamic Malware Analysis

## Dynamic Malware Analysis

Idea: **run the malware** in a sandbox (VM, debugger, ...) and use tools to analyze its behavior.

* We are interested in observing:
    * Memory accesses
    * Network activity
    * Disk activity
* Observation tools must be placed **outside** the sandbox.
* At a **lower level** w.r.t. the malware.
* In theory, completely *transparent* to the malware.
* *Not so simple...*

## Virtualization is like dreaming

* Unsure if you're living in a dream, or awake?
    * Look for **artifacts** (i.e. anomalies) in your reality.

**Malware can do the same...**

## Artifacts and environment-aware malware

### Observer effect

Execution of software into a debugger or VM leaves **artifacts**.

* Artifacts are evidences of an "artificial" environment.
* According to \cite{Garfinkel07}, *building a transparent VMM is fundamentally infeasible*.

### Malware resistance to dynamic analysis

If the malware is able to detect artifacts, it **can resist to traditional dynamic analysis tools.**

1. Remain inactive (not trigger the payload)
1. Abort or crash its host
1. Disable defenses or tools

## Artifacts: some examples

\cite{Chen08}, \cite{Garfinkel07} provide a taxonomy of artifacts:

* **Hardware**
    * Special devices or adapters in VMs
    * Specific manufacturer prefixes on device names
* **Memory**
    * Hypervisors placing interrupt table in different positions
    * Too little RAM (typical of VMs)
* **Software**
    * Presence of installed tools on the system
    * `isDebuggerPresent()` Windows API
* **Behavior**
    * Timing differences (e.g. interception of privileged instructions in VMMs)

## Semantic Gap

Our aim is to **understand what the malware is doing**. Need to mine **semantics** from the extracted raw data.

* From raw data:
    * Disk read at sector *123*
    * TCP packet *ABC*
    * Some bytes at memory address `0xDEADBEEF`
* To concise, high-level event descriptions:
    * `/etc/passwd` has been read
    * A connection to `badguy.com` has been opened

LO-PHI uses well-known **forensic tools**, adapted for live analysis:

* Disk forensics: **Sleuthkit**
* Memory forensics: **Volatility**

## Malware Analysis Framework Evaluation

Tradeoff between:

1. *Low-artifact, semantically poor* tools (Virtual Machine Introspection)
1. *High-artifact, semantically-rich* frameworks (debuggers)

# LO-PHI: Low-Observable Physical Host Instrumentation for Malware Analysis

## Goals

* **No virtualization**: run malware on bare metal machines!
    * Physical sensors and actuators.
* Bridging the **semantic gap**
    * Physical sensors collect raw data.
* **Automated restore** to pre-infection state.
* **Stealthiness**: very few, undetectable artifacts.
* **Extendability**: support new OSs and filesystems.

## Threat model

Assumptions on our model of malware: they are **limitations** of the approach.

* Malicious modifications evident either in memory or on disk
* No infection delivered to hardware
* Instrumentation is in place before malware is executed
    * Malware cannot analyze the system without LO-PHI in place.
    * Harder to compare and detect artifacts: **no baseline**.

## Sensors and actuators (1)

![Hardware instrumentation to inspect a bare-metal machine.](images/hardware-setup.pdf){height=95% width=95%}

## Sensors and actuators (2)

### Sensors

* **Memory**. Xilinx ML507 board connected to PCIe, reads and writes arbitrary memory locations via DMA.
* **Disk**. ML507 board intercepting all the traffic over SATA interface. Sends SATA frames via Gigabit Ethernet and UDP.
    * Completely passive...
    * except when SATA data rate exceeds Ethernet bandwidth: throttling of frames.
* **Network interface**. Mentioned in paper, but the technology used is unclear.

### Actuators

An Arduino Leonardo emulates **USB keyboard and mouse**.

## Infrastructure

### Restoring physical machines

* We cannot simply "restore a snapshot" like in VMs.
* **Preboot Execute Environment** (PXE) with **CloneZilla**
    * Allows to restore the disk to a previously saved state
    * No interaction with the OS
* Also, DNS and DHCP servers.

### Scalable infrastructure

* Job submission system: jobs are sent to a **scheduler**
* The scheduler executes the routine on an appropriate machine
* **Python interface** to control the machine and run malware and analysis

## Bridging the semantic gap via forensic analysis

* Non-malicious software was also run to identify and extract "background noise".

# Experiments

## Experiment on evasive malware

Malware previously labeled as "evasive" was executed on Windows 7 and analyzed using LO-PHI.

* Many samples clearly exhibited **typical malware behavior**.
* Some samples failed because of no network connection, or wrong Windows version.

> [...] we feel that our findings are more that sufficient to showcase LO-PHIâ€™s ability to analyze evasive malware, without being subverted, and subsequently produce high-fidelity results for further analysis.

# Critique

## Known limitations

* Newer chipsets use IOMMUs, **disabling DMA** from peripherals.
    * Current memory acquisition technique will become unusable.
* **Smearing**: the memory can change *during* the acquisition
    * Inconsistent states.
    * Faster polling rates can help.
* **Filesystem caching**: some data will not pass through SATA interface.
    * Malware could write a file to disk cache, execute and delete it before the cached is flushed to disk.
    * However the effects would be visible in memory.

## Issues with the technique and the experiments

* The malware is left to run only 3 minutes.
    * Many malwares need much more time to fully uncover their effects (e.g. ransomware).
* **No memory polling** during the execution of the malware.
    * Only snapshot before and after the execution.
    * Temporary data used by the malware is never seen.
* Assumption: **malware does not modify BIOS or firmware**.
    * But if it does, the physical machine could not be recoverable.
    * Costly!
* **No Internet access**: the authors always run the malware on disconnected machines.
    * Most malware becomes useless without Command&Control infrastructure.
    * Network access could expose further, unseen, artifacts.

## Methodological issues

* The article claims that the artifacts from LO-PHI are unusable by malware because there's **no baseline** (i.e. the malware cannot see the machine before the installation of LO-PHI).
    * This can also be true for traditional approaches.
* **No statistical test** used to discover whether difference in disk/memory throughput is statistically significant (presence of artifacts).
    * Very simple and standard procedure, should really be done in a scientific paper.
* **Network analysis** technique is not described and unclear.
    * *We exclude the network trace analysis from much of our discussion since it is a well-known technique and not the focus of our work.*

## Memory throughput
![Average memory throughput comparison as reported by RAMSpeed, with and without instrumentation. Deviation from uninstrumented trial is only 0.4% in worst case. **No statistical test used.**](images/mem-throughput.pdf)

## Another point...

* **Virtualization is increasingly used** in production contexts.
    * Just think about **cloud computing**!
* Attackers will want to target those VMs \cite{Garfinkel07}.
* Malware that deactivates in VMs will be less common.

# Related and future work

## Related work

### Traditional dynamic analysis
Many dynamic malware analysis tools rely on virtualization: Ether, BitBlaze, Anubis, V2E, HyperDbg, SPIDER.

* We already saw the limitations of VM approaches: **artifacts**.

### Bare-metal dynamic analysis

**BareBox** \cite{BareBox11}: malware analysis framework based on a bare-metal machine without virtualization or emulations

* Only targets user-mode malware.
* Only disk analysis (no memory tools).

## Future evolutions

### Automated, repeated analyses

* **Disk restore** phase is the lengthiest (> 6 min): should be optimized.
* *The resetting and boot process could be decreased significantly by writing a custom PXE loader, or completely mitigated by implementing copy-on-write into our FPGA.*
* *While snapshots are trivial with virtual machines, it is still an open problem for physical machines.*

### Extensions

* Analyze **transient behavior** of binary
    * Continuous memory polling
    * Need to deal with DMA artifacts
* Cover **malware that infects hardware** (BIOS, firmware).
